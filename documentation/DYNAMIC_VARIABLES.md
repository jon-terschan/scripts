# REMODELING DATA
We downloaded and tested both ERA5-Land and CERRA-Land data as reference data sets of ambient climate. CERRA has a better spatial but worse time resolution than ERA-5 Land, so it likely captures the ocean-land climatic gradient better. 

# MICROCLIMATE MEASUREMENTS
## CLF CONVERSION
Scripts used to convert different native logger formats into a common logger format (CLF). Scripts available for SurveyTag and TOMST (TMS4, Thermologgers). CLF looks as follows: 

| datetime                  	| t1   	| t2   	| t3   	| SMC 	|
|---------------------------	|------	|------	|------	|-----	|
| 2024-03-01 00:00:00+00:00 	| 19.5 	| 21.1 	| 22.1 	| 500 	|
| 2024-03-01 00:15:00+00:00 	| 19.6 	| 21.2 	| 22.2 	| 505 	|
| 2024-03-01 00:30:00+00:00 	| 19.2 	| 20.8 	| 21.6 	| 508 	|

datetime is the timestamp in datetime format and UTC timezone. Conversion to UTC is necessary because TOMST loggers record in UTC. Note that is extremely important to keep track of your logger's local timezones, in order to (re)convert timezones.

t1 is soil temperature sensor (if present) in degrees Celsius.
t2 is surface temperature sensor reading (if present) in degrees Celsius
t3 is air temperature sensor reading in degrees Celsius.
SMC is soil moisture count if available. 

## QA

Scripts to conduct various pre-processing and quality assessment operations. 

## date_filter
Filters out data prior to the start of measurements. TOMST loggers always record and cannot be turned off, so they will produce heaps of unrelated signals. The date filter assumes a period of relative temperature stability as the loggers are stored in air conditioning (~21 deg room temperature). This means the date filter won't work correctly if the time series contains real signal from an earlier field campaign. 

Date filter is the script in which I figured out the logic. Loop script does the same in batch.

## big_QA 
Performs various preprocessing operations in batch and spits out a report that allows you to identify which files need special attention. QA is quite conservative, because I have not tested function behavior extensively on the available data. 

## Sledgehammer 
A script for manual quality improvements that still remain after the big_QA, basically the final cleanup. Has some functions to remove and interpolate data and other data curation functions, including a function to remove faulty soil temperature readings and flag out-of-soil (OOS) periods in the data.

Note that there is no functions to fill large gaps in time series. 

## Duplicate detector
Deprecated script to detect timestamp duplicates (faulty measurements). Used for diagnostics, but vibecoded and not refactored.  

## Outlier detection
Deprecated first attempt at writing an outlier detection. Works, but the fine tuning takes too much time and in the end I had to do so much manual data curation anyways, it was easier to just manually remove extreme outliers.
